# MechBot-OpenGL
A 3D game created using OpenGL in C where the user controls a cannon and defends against incoming enemy mechanical robots.

The user controls a cannon, moving left and right along the field and shooting with the spacebar, and has to defeat incoming bots. The incoming bots 
move in a wave towards the cannon, while firing at it. The user must avoid being hit and defeat the bots before they reach the end of the field.
The game can be played in either first or third person, switching at the users will.
